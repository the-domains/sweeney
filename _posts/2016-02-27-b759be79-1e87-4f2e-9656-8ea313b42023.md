Five Lefts make a Right, right?

Hi, my name is Steve and I am planning to start sharing the crazy journey that I call my life.  Hopefully these stories will be insightful or even contain life changing advise but most likely they will just be a bunch of random anecdotal stories like how I got my head stuck into a honey jar.  

I hope you enjoy this crazy path that I'm journeying down and if you don't I'm sorry but there are no refunds.  On the bright side, I have not found it boring yet so I hope you don't either. 

Your guide though my life,

Steve Sweeney
