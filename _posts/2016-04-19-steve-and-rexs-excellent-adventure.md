During the month of May, Rex and I will be going on the most epic of adventures. We will be traveling across this great country of ours while having the most triumphant time! We will be traveling down to Atlanta for a week (May 1st to 7th), taking on one Tough Mudder (May 7th), partying out in Austin, TX (May 8th - 9th), sightseeing Flagstaff/Grand Canyon (May 10th - 11th), catching a sunset in Malibu (May 12th), cruise up the 101 (May 13th), get a little weird in San Francisco (May 13th - May 16th), feel small under the Red Woods (May 17th), remember the 90's with Tim in Portland (May 18th - May 20th), throw a few fish around in Seattle (May 21st - 23rd), get my run an stretch on during a Wanderlust (May 22nd), visit a strange foreign land in Vancouver (May 23rd), split a picnic basket with Yogi the Bear at Yellowstone National Park (May 24th - May 27th), figure out how to get our faces onto Mt Rushmore (May 28th), eat some cheese in Madison, WI (May 29th) and finally return to Chicago (May 30th).

Don't worry strange things will be afoot at the Circle-K.
